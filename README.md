  - I think the best way for practice-focused methodology is something like ['practice — learning — practice'](http://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-for-programmers/#comment-358985), that means where students first come with some existing projects with problems and solutions (practice) to get familiar with traditional methods in the area and perhaps also with their methodology. After practicing with some elementary experiences, they can go into the books and study the underlying theory, which serves to guide their future advanced practice and will enhance their toolbox of solving practical problems. Studying theory also further improves their understanding on the elementary experiences, and will help them acquire advanced experiences more quickly.

At each time step the RNN outputs next word and the next location to pay attention to via a probability over grid locations. Uses 2 types of attention soft and hard. Soft attention uses gradient descent and backprop and is deterministic. Hard attention selects the element with highest probability. Hard attention uses reinforcement learning, rather than backprop and is stochastic.
